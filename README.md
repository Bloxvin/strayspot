# strayspotter
A web platform leveraging Wasabi cloud services, enabling cat lovers to share pictures of stray cats. The data collected will be analyzed to provide insights into the environment and status of stray cats.

Used node.js and express.js for client-server communication.
Used SQL for web datastorage for faster data transfer between client and webserver.
Used wasabi cloud for long-term storage of the pictures and location data.

I was responsible for API integration between client to web server, and from webserver to cloud, node.js and express.js.

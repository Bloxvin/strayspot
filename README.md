# strayspot
My first year project with Kim and Alex. Record and spot cats locally to help them against environmental dangers. Used EXIF data and geolocation to track cat picture's location. Used node.js and express.js for client-server relation. Used wasabi cloud for cloud storage of the pictures and geolocation data. Used onemap to locate them on the map.
